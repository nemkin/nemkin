### Hi there! :smiley:

I'm researching quantum computing, currently quantum walks.

:coffee: Check out my stuff!

- The [Quantum walk simulator](https://github.com/nemkin/quantum) I have been working on.
- The accompanying research report, [Simulation of quantum walks on a classical computer](https://github.com/nemkin/tdk/blob/main/thesis.pdf) (in English).
- And some cool [quantum walk simulation videos](https://nemk.in/quantum).

I'm also a TA at the Department of Computer Science and Information Theory at BUTE.

- My website is https://cs.bme.hu/~nemkin/.
- The website for our quantum algorithms research group is: https://cs.bme.hu/quantum (in Hungarian)

:envelope: Send me an email, I would love to talk!
