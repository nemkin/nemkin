:wave: Hi there! I'm Vikt√≥ria. :)  
:eyes: I'm researching quantum & classical algorithms for solving bioinformatical problems & writing quantum algorithm simulation software.  
:revolving_hearts: I'm looking to collaborate with someone with a biochemistry background on computer-assisted drug discovery.  
:envelope: Reach me via e-mail @ nemkin@cs.bme.hu

:coffee: Check out my stuff!

Quantum simulations:

- [qmem](https://github.com/nemkin/qmem): A general-purpose, memory-optimized quantum algorithm simulator framewok.
  - [tdk-2022](https://github.com/nemkin/tdk-2022): Optimizing memory usage in quantum algorithm simulation (the accompanying research report in English).
- [quantum-walk](https://github.com/nemkin/quantum-walk): Quantum walk simulations.
  - [tdk-2021](https://github.com/nemkin/tdk-2021): Simulation of quantum walks on a classical computer (the accompanying research report in English).

Some cool [quantum walk simulation videos](https://nemk.in/quantum).

I'm also a teacher at the Department of Computer Science and Information Theory at Budapest University of Technology and Economics.
