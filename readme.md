:wave: Hi there! I'm Vikt√≥ria. :)  
:eyes: I'm researching quantum & classical algorithms for solving bioinformatical problems.  
:revolving_hearts: I'm looking to collaborate with someone with a biochemistry background on computer-assisted drug discovery.  
:envelope: Reach me via e-mail @ nemkin@cs.bme.hu

:coffee: Check out my stuff!

- The [Quantum walk simulator](https://github.com/nemkin/quantum) I have been working on.
- The accompanying research report, [Simulation of quantum walks on a classical computer](https://github.com/nemkin/tdk/blob/main/thesis.pdf) (in English).
- And some cool [quantum walk simulation videos](https://nemk.in/quantum).

I'm also a teacher at the Department of Computer Science and Information Theory at Budapest University of Technology and Economics.
