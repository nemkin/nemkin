### Hi there! :smiley:

I'm researching quantum computing, currently quantum walks.

Check out my stuff! :coffee:

- The [Quantum walk simulator](https://github.com/nemkin/quantum) I wrote in Python.
- The accompanying research report, [Simulation of quantum walks on a classical computer](https://github.com/nemkin/tdk/blob/main/thesis.pdf) (in English).
- And some cool [quantum walk simulation videos](https://nemk.in/quantum).

:envelope: Send me an email, I would love to talk!
